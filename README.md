# Phauxth authentication example Phoenix app

An example Phoenix app using the [Phauxth authentication library](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth).

This example was generated by running the following commands:

```elixir
mix phx.new forks_the_egg_sample # or any other suitable app name
cd forks_the_egg_sample
mix phauxth.new --confirm --remember --no-backups
```

and then adding the following lines to the deps section in the mix.exs file:

```elixir
{:phauxth, "~> 1.1"}`,
{:bcrypt_elixir, "~> 1.0"},
{:bamboo, "~> 0.8"},
```

## Running the Phoenix app

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

For information about running Phoenix in production [check the Phoenix deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
