# Phauxth authentication example Phoenix app

An example Phoenix app using the [Phauxth authentication library](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth).

This example was generated by running the following commands:

```elixir
mix phx.new forks_the_egg_sample # or any other suitable app name
cd forks_the_egg_sample
mix phauxth.new --confirm --remember
```

and then making these changes:

* adding `{:phauxth, "~> 1.1"}`, `{:argon2_elixir, "~> 1.2"}` and `{:bamboo, "~> 0.8"}`
to the mix.exs file
* replacing Bcrypt with Argon2 in the lib/forks_the_egg_sample/accounts/user.ex file
* adding `crypto: Comeonin.Argon2` to the login function in the
lib/forks_the_egg_sample_web/controllers/session_controller.ex file

## Running the Phoenix app

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

For information about running Phoenix in production [check the Phoenix deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
