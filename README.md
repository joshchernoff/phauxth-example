# Phauxth authentication example Phoenix app

An example Phoenix app using the [Phauxth authentication library](https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth).

This example was generated by running the following commands:

```elixir
mix archive.install https://github.com/riverrun/phauxth_installer/blob/master/archives/phauxth_new.ez
mix phx.new forks_the_egg_sample # or any other suitable app name
cd forks_the_egg_sample
mix phauxth.new --confirm --remember --no-backups
```

and then adding the following lines to the deps section in the mix.exs file:

```elixir
{:phauxth, "~> 1.2"}`,
{:bcrypt_elixir, "~> 1.0"},
{:bamboo, "~> 0.8"},
```

## Setting up bamboo email library

The bamboo email library is configured in the `config/config.exs`, using
the LocalAdapter, and `config/test.exs`, using the TestAdapter, files.

The LocalAdapter is great for development, but to actually send emails to
users, you will need to setup a different adapter. For more information
about the available adapters, see the [bamboo README](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bamboo).

## Running the Phoenix app

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Run `brunch build` from the proect /assets directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

For information about running Phoenix in production [check the Phoenix deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
